# CTGAN_Reimplemented

This repository reimplements the paper: Modeling Tabular Data using Conditional GAN(https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00503). Most of the code is from the original repository https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN/tree/main, but without using another external library rdt(https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT/tree/main). Main objective of this repository is to try to understand the paper better by implementing the model and understanding what each lines of code do.
